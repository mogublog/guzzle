# Guzzle, PHP HTTP client

Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client that makes it easy to send HTTP requests and
trivial to integrate with web services.

- Simple interface for building query strings, POST requests, streaming large
  uploads, streaming large downloads, using HTTP cookies, uploading JSON data,
  etc...
- Can send both synchronous and asynchronous requests using the same interface.
- Uses PSR-7 interfaces for requests, responses, and streams. This allows you
  to utilize other PSR-7 compatible libraries with Guzzle.
- Supports PSR-18 allowing interoperability between other PSR-18 HTTP Clients.
- Abstracts away the underlying HTTP transport, allowing you to write
  environment and transport agnostic code; i.e., no hard dependency on cURL,
  PHP streams, sockets, or non-blocking event loops.
- Middleware system allows you to augment and compose client behavior.

```php
$client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
$response = $client->request('GET', 'https://api.github.com/repos/guzzle/guzzle');

echo $response->getStatusCode(); // 200
echo $response->getHeaderLine('content-type'); // 'application/json; charset=utf8'
echo $response->getBody(); // '{"id": 1420053, "name": "guzzle", ...}'

// Send an asynchronous request.
$request = new \GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org');
$promise = $client->sendAsync($request)->then(function ($response) {
    echo 'I completed! ' . $response->getBody();
});

$promise->wait();
```
